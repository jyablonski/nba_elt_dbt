Very good debut for the #1 pick. Looked very capable on the offensive side and held his own on defense. Showed some pretty good playmaking flashes and was really good at finishing around the rim. Didn''t attempt a single 3, but hopefully will have that in his arsenal.

Also is the fourth player in the last 30 seasons to record at least 20p/5reb/5a in his NBA debut along with Grant Hill, Lebron James and Michael Carter-Williams. Led the game in scoring.
