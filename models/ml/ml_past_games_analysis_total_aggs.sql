-- this model grabs all ml predictions from entire season and runs aggregations to find correct prediction %.
-- it excludes tonight's games because we don't know whether the ml model is correct or incorrect on those predictions yet.

-- ml_game_predictions has to be a source bc im making that table externally in an ecs python script
