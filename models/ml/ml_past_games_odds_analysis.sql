/*
this model grabs all ml predictions from entire season and joins the odds data

end goal is to do some odds + ML analysis and see if i can find value in automating when bets should be placed for maximum $ returns.

right now this is just the base table, the actual analysis is gnna have to do some joins with ml_accuracy, home+away moneyline, and actual outcome
